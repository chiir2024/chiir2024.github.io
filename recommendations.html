    <p>
      The conference venues are located approximately equidistant from two bustling Sheffield neighbourhoods, both of which feature some excellent independent shops, restaurants, pubs and cafes (and the usual chains, if you really must!). Broomhill is located uphill from the conference venues; Sharrow Vale/Ecclesall ("Eccy") Road is downhill. If you're looking for some great pubs and a thriving restaurant scene, we would also recommend heading across the city to Kelham Island, where the conference banquet will take place.
