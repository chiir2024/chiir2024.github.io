		<h1>Conference Venue</h1>
		<p>CHIIR 2024 will be held at three venues. The main conference (11th - 13th) will take place at the Edge; the tutorials, workshops, and DC (10th and 14th) will be at <a href="https://www.halifaxhall.co.uk/contact-us/" target="_blank">Halifax Hall</a>. Both venues are located within the leafy University of Sheffield student village and are near to the Botanical Gardens and the trendy neighbourhood around Hunters Bar. <br />The conference banquet will take place at <a href="https://www.sheffieldmuseums.org.uk/venue-hire/venues/kelham-island-museum/" target="_blank">Kelham Island Museum</a>.</p>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> we will provide most meals during the conference - this is included as part of your conference registration fee. This includes: breakfasts, lunches, 2 coffee/tea breaks per day from Sunday to Thursday; two receptions on Sunday and Monday, and the conference banquet on Tuesday.</p>

		<h1>SIGIR Student Travel Grants</h1>
		<p>
			The <a href="https://sigir.org/general-information/travel-grants/" target="_blank">SIGIR Student Travel Grant Program</a> is pleased to offer Student Travel Grants for students presenting their accepted contributions at CHIIR 2024.</p>

		<p>To be eligible, the student must: (1) be an author of an accepted contribution and (2) be the one presenting the accepted contribution.  Further, students should not register before notifications, and SIGIR Travel Award does not reimburse tuition fees. 
		</p>
		<p>These awards are competitive (i.e., not every applicant will receive a grant).  We will prioritize students presenting with accepted contributions on the main conference track; students from underrepresented countries; and students who have not received a grant in the past. </p>
 <p>To be considered for a grant, the student must submit an application and their academic advisor must complete a statement of support (a link to the advisor will be sent directly as soon as the student provides all the information requested in their application). </p>

 <p>For awardees, the grant will cover the cost of in-person registration and a stipend towards travel and accommodation costs. </p>

 <p>The application period is December 13th to December 28th (AoE).  The application and statement of support must be submitted before the end of the application period. </p>
