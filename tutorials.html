<h1>NORMalize: A Tutorial on the Normative Design and Evaluation of Recommender Systems [Half day, Sunday]</h1>

<p>
<strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/normalizeworkshop" target="_blank">https://sites.google.com/view/normalizeworkshop</a>
</p>	

<p>
Abstract: Information systems, both retrieval and recommender, are among the most widely used applications of artificial intelligence. Since they are so widely used, it is important that we, as practitioners and researchers, think about the impact these systems may have on users, society, and other stakeholders. To that effect, the NORMalize tutorial seeks to introduce normative thinking, to consider the norms and values that underpin these systems. The objective of NORMalize is to bring together a growing community of researchers and practitioners across disciplines who want to think about the norms and values that should be considered in the design and evaluation of information retrieval systems; and to further educate them on how to reflect on, prioritise, and operationalise such norms and values. NORMalize is a half day tutorial and consists of a short lecture on normative thinking and an interactive session. It had its first successful run at RecSysâ€™23.

<h1>Search under Uncertainty: Cognitive Biases and Heuristics - Tutorial on Modeling Search Interaction using Behavioral Economics [Half day, Thursday]</h1>

<p>
<strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://beiir.github.io/" target="blank">https://beiir.github.io/</a>
</p>	

<p>
Abstract: This half-day tutorial will provide a starting point for researchers seeking to learn more about searching under uncertainty.
The tutorial includes two parts.  First, we will provide an introduction of the biases and heuristics program put forward by Tversky and Kahneman (1974).
The second part of the tutorial will provide an overview of cognitive biases in search, before doing a deep dive into examples and the impact of biases on varying decisions while information seeking. 
The tutorial will conclude with a discussion of the practical implication for how we can better design bias-aware IR systems.

<h1>The concept of information needs and its operationalization in CHIIR research [Half day, Thursday]</h1>

<p>
<strong>Programme:</strong> <a href="https://chiir2024.github.io/CHIIR24_InformationNeeds_Tutorial.pdf" target="blank">Information needs tutorial</a>
</p>
		
<p>
Abstract: One of the most utilized concepts in CHIIR research is 'information need', which has been used as part of research designs in both qualitative and quantitative studies, either as an integral element of experiments and evaluations or as an explanatory aspect of information searching. Its definitions and operationalizations are likewise many and they often remain vague hindering the possibility to credibly compare findings. This tutorial will help participants to use the concept more precisely and appropriately in their own research.
The tutorial consists of talks by experienced researchers combined with small group and plenary sessions. Programme now available.
